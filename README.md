This is a functional expression parser. It is an experiment in parsing
using recursive descent with operator precedence. It can be compiled with an
expression such as "30 * 5 + 4" and it will parse and evaluate the expression
with correct mathematical precedence.

Compile this with C++14 standard enabled.

P.S. Yes I know that "using namespace std;" in a header is bad form. This is just an experiment.
